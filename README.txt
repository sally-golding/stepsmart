Pre-Alpha build outlined work:
- aquired Arduino Nano 33 BLE Rev 2, prototype shoe insoles, one pressure sensor to test, connectors, rechargable lithium 5V battery
- tested compatability of battery voltage with Arduino
- downloaded board type to Arduino IDE
- ensured compatable connectors
- loaded simple accelerometer and gyro code to the arduino, tested for functionality
- researched Arduino bluetooth
- began app UI

Bugs:
- funky numbers from gyroscope values, will need to add a calibration detail to the code
