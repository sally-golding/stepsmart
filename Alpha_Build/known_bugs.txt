StepSmart Mobile Application Known Bugs / Limitations

1. Foot heatmap visualization is not fully complete; pressure-to-color mapping needs refinement and radial gradient between sensor regions is not yet implemented; 
  visualization does not represent an anatomically accurate foot layout.
2. Heatmap layout relies on fixed dimensions and may not scale correctly on different screen sizes.
3. Application assumes valid BLE data is received; partial, delayed, or inaccurate data is not handled.
4. Pressure data is limited to three sensor points.
5. Pressure averages are calculated after disconnecting from device, preventing real-time updates.
6. Accelerometer and gyroscope averaging buffers are not cleared between sessions.
7. Stride and gait analysis features are not yet implemented; only raw accelerometer and gyroscope data is displayed currently.
8. Mobile application is supported on Android devices only.
9. Automatic reconnection is not supported if BLE connection is lost or interrupted.
