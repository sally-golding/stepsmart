StepSmart Recommended Test Cases
--------------------------------

1. Confirm reliable BLE data transmission to Android app for a full usage session

2. Confirm that all three pressure sensors transmit valid data

3. Evaluate how the system behaves when BLE connection is lost during a usage ession (Error Message)

4. Measure stability of sensor readings over time

5. Verify that pressure data maps correctly to the heatmap visualization

6. Check how the system behaves if the insole is used incorrectly (should display inconsistent results)

7. Verify that the mobile application correctly receives and processes live sensor data from the Arduino
