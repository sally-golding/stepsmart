1. Vertical Oscillation Metric

Vertical Oscillation:

- previous wearable devices have used metrics such as vertical oscillation (VO)

- VO is the up‑and‑down movement of a runner’s trunk/center of mass

- a higher VO is shown to lead to higher oxygen/energetic cost

- a lower VO can indicate better running capability

- a typical VO is between 5cm and 10cm

- the difference between maximum and minimum position of the marker in the vertical axis is calculated for each stride to derive vertical oscillation


Formula:

- VO = ∫(t0 to t1) [ ∫(t0 to t) (az(τ) - g) dτ ] dt

- g = 9.81, (gravity)

- az(t) is accelerometer Z multiplied by g

2. Foot Strike Metric

Center of Pressure:

- a center‑of‑pressure approach where the pressure sensors can be used to compute foot‑strike location (heel/mid/fore) has been used

- a prior study tested whether a three‑sensor insole could accurately estimate center of pressure

- the conclusion of the study indicated that three sensors give useful estimates for field use

- limitations were reduced precision at the very start and end of stance

Formula:

- x_COP(t) = (sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t) * x_i) / (sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t))

- x_COP(t) is center of pressure

- n is the number of sensors

3. Symmetry Index Metric

Symmetry Index:

- percentage that shows how different one side of your step is from the other

- it tells whether your left and right steps are balanced or if one side is doing more work

- increases in asymmetry can foreshadow pain or injury

Formula:

- SI = 100  (L - R) / (0.5  (L + R))

- L is the average value of the per‑stride on the left side

- R is the average value of the per‑stride on the right side

5. Update Ideas

Add metric‑specific processing:

- integrate VO calculation, COP computation, and symmetry calculations

Integrate metric interpretation: 

- add simple explanations to tell users what their values mean, ex: high VO = less efficient

- add simple charts or color indicators
