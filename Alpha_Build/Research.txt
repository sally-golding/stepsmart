1. Vertical Oscillation Metric

Vertical Oscillation:

- previous wearable devices have used metrics such as vertical oscillation (VO)

- VO is the up‑and‑down movement of a runner’s trunk/center of mass

- a higher VO is shown to lead to higher oxygen/energetic cost

- a lower VO can indicate better running capability

- a typical VO is between 5cm and 10cm

- the difference between maximum and minimum position of the marker in the vertical axis is calculated for each stride to derive vertical oscillation


Formula:

- VO = ∫(t0 to t1) [ ∫(t0 to t) (az(τ) - g) dτ ] dt

- g = 9.81, (gravity)

- az(t) is accelerometer Z multiplied by g

2. Foot Strike Metric

Center of Pressure:

- a center‑of‑pressure approach where the pressure sensors can be used to compute foot‑strike location (heel/mid/fore) has been used

- a prior study tested whether a three‑sensor insole could accurately estimate center of pressure

- the conclusion of the study indicated that three sensors give useful estimates for field use

- limitations were reduced precision at the very start and end of stance

Formula:

- x_COP(t) = (sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t) * x_i) / (sum_{i=1}^n p_i(t))

- x_COP(t) is center of pressure

- n is the number of sensors

3. Symmetry Index Metric

Symmetry Index:

- percentage that shows how different one side of your step is from the other

- it tells whether your left and right steps are balanced or if one side is doing more work

- increases in asymmetry can foreshadow pain or injury

Formula:

- SI = 100  (L - R) / (0.5  (L + R))

- L is the average value of the per‑stride on the left side

- R is the average value of the per‑stride on the right side

4. Initial Contact Force Analysis

By using the pressure sensors, the application should determine which area of the foot makes initial contact when landing. The application should display this information as a simple average to let the user know which part of the foot they consistently land with first. This information is helpful to let a user ensure that they are striking with the desired part of the foot, as heelstriking is considered less natural and comfortable than forefoot striking.

Additionally, this force data can be coupled with IMU data to provide real-time gait feedback. If the system detects that the user is striking the ground with too much or too little force, the application should display simple actionable feedback phrases, such as “run softer” or “run lighter.”

How to Replicate this in the App:

Since the pressure sensors are positioned in a way that divides the foot into a forefoot, midfoot, and rearfoot position, data can be sampled to determine which part of the sole gets an appropriate pressure reading first. However, a minimum force threshold is needed to be surpassed for a strike of contact to be registered.

During a period of running, multiple points of contact should be recorded with their associated pressure forces. If these forces exceed an anticipated value for the user, actionable feedback should be displayed to correct the user’s technique.

5. Fatigue Tracking

By analyzing a user's gait patterns over a session of running (with IMU and accelerometer data), it is possible to detect signs of fatigue in the user. However, a complex algorithm that can detect outliers in gait patterns would have to be developed. On the other hand, machine learning models can also be used to detect these outliers that indicate fatigue, but these models would be quite difficult to train and create.

Instead of relying on a complex algorithm or machine learning, it may be possible to use the tracked spatiotemporal parameters, such as stride length, and check for notable outliers in a session of running. If these parameters start to suddenly show a different trend toward the later part of a running session, this could suggest that the runner is experiencing fatigue.

How to Replicate this in the App:

In order to implement this method of fatigue tracking, the other spatiotemporal parameters would have to be tracked over a session of running. This is talked about more in Section 6 of this document.

6. Other Metrics in Prior Insoles

Common Spatiotemporal Metrics Include:

- Center of pressure

- Plantar forces

- Pressure distribution 

- Step count

- Stride length

Based on research, it is evident that these spatiotemporal metrics are important to runners. These metrics provide confirmation whether appropriate technique is being used in respect to the user's velocity. Research also shows how these spatiotemporal metrics should scale as runners become better at their craft, with elite runners showing different trends in recorded metrics from novice runners.

7. Implementation Ideas

Add metric‑specific processing:

- integrate VO calculation, COP computation, symmetry calculations, stride length, and so on. However, as a team we need to decide which metrics we should prioritize and work on refining the computations needed to appropriately implement these metrics

Integrate metric interpretation: 

- add simple explanations to tell users what their values mean, ex: high VO = less efficient

- add simple charts or color indicators
